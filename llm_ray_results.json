AI is the science of machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. So, it's about making machines do things like learning, problem-solving, or making decisions.\n\nFirst, I should define it clearly. Maybe start with simple terms. Then explain the different types of AI. There's machine learning, which is a subset where AI learns from data. Then there's natural language processing, which allows AI to understand and generate human language. Computer vision is another area, where AI can process images and videos. \n\nI should",
